# Document Analysis Project using Mistral AI and React JS.
## Project Scope
This code is written for a React-based web application that extracts and analyzes the content of Google Docs documents. The application's functionality is as follows:

-Fetching Google Docs Content: The user inputs a Google Docs URL. The content is fetched from this URL and converted into editable text.

-Converting Text to Image: The fetched text is converted into an image using the convertTextToImage function. This image visually presents the content of the document.

-Analyzing with Mistral API: The text and image are analyzed using the Mistral AI (with the pixtral-12b model). The application examines the design, content, layout, and headings of the Google Docs and provides suggestions to the user.

-Analysis Results: Once the analysis is complete, the user is provided with improvement suggestions regarding design and content. The analysis includes recommendations on how to enhance the layout, headings, and other sections of the document.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
